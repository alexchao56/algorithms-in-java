/** The following is an implementation of a binary search tree (BST). 
 * It is a node-based binary tree data structure with the folowing properties:
 * 1) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * 2) The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * 3) Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
